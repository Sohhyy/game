        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Wizard Knight is a 3D TPS game which is the course project of "Game Design and Development". It is also the first game I made. It contains both single-player mode and multiplayer online mode. For single-player mode, the player needs to control a wizard to defeat waves of monsters, explore the map and finally defeat the boss.  For multiplayer online mode, there are multiple players in the arena battle. Players are supposed to kill other rivals as well as protect themselves and try to get the highest kill/death ratio. We also implemented an online chatroom in this mode.

        </p>
         <hr class="star-primary">
        <h3>My Contributions</h3>
        <p>I am the gameplay programmer and level designer of the single-player mode. I am responsible for all the design and programming works in single-player mode except map design. Since I am a big fan of Dark Souls, I learned a lot from Dark Souls and make this TPS game contain many RPG elements. I will briefly introduce how I design the main character, the enemies and the level. </p>
         <hr class="star-primary">
        <h3>Character Design</h3>
        <p>The main character is a wizard. The wizard can use three different magic. The first one is the fireball. It doesn't cost mana. The second one is ice magic. It will slow down the enemy. Its damage is low, and it will cost mana. This magic has a long cool down time. The third magic is speed up magic. After using this magic, the player can move faster. It will also cost mana. The player can use this magic to dodge the enemy's attack.</p>
         <hr class="star-primary">
        <h3>Enemies Design</h3>
        <p>There are four types of enemies. </p>
        <p>The first type is the Goblin. The AI of the goblin is easy. If the player enters the alert range or being attackted by the player, the goblin will begin to chase the player. If the distance between the goblin and the player is close enough, the goblin will stop to attack the player with its sword.</p>
        <p>The second type is the Skeleton Knight. Its logic is very similar to the goblin's AI. One thing different is that if the player is far away from it, it will raise a shield to defend. At this time, it will not be harmed by the player. Only when the player is close to it will it show weakness. This design will force the players to battle with Skeleton Knight in a very close distance.</p>
        <p>The third type is Evil Watcher. Its logic is also very similar to the goblin's AI. One thing different is that it flies on the sky and uses ranged magic attack. Also, after each attacking, it will move a distance in a random direction. This design will increase the difficulties of players to aim at this enemy. </p>
        <p>The fourth type is the final boss - Demon Lord. This boss has three stages. At the first stage, Demon Lord will use its sword and whip to attack the player. When its health drops to two thirds, it will fly to the sky. And it will use the fire dragon magic. Many fire dragon will appear on the ground. The player will get hurt if he/she is attacked by the fire dragon. After using fire dragon magic, the Demon Lord will return to the ground and become to the second stage. At this stage, it will move faster and its damage also become higher. When its health drops to one third, it will fly to the sky again and use fire tornado magic. It will summon many fire tornados on the ground and these fire tornado will chase the player. Each fire tornado will last for 10 seconds. After all the fire tornados disappear, the boss comes to the third stage. At this stage, its attack mode is the same as before. But it will summon two fire tornados every 10 seconds. The player needs to attack the boss while dodging fire tornado. </p>

        <h3>Level Design</h3>
        <p>Level design follows the principle of from simple to difficult. There are six waves of enemies. The propose of the first three waves is to let the player get familiar with how to control the character and the attack mode of each enemy. Goblin is the simplest enemy. Therefore, the first wave of enemies contains two goblins. And then the player needs to defeat the Skeleton Knight. The third wave is the Evil Watcher. After getting familiar with the enemies, in the fourth and fifth waves, the player needs to fight with these three types of enemies together. The fourth wave contains more goblins and Skeleton Knights and the fifth wave contains more Evil Watcher. This slight change makes players need to use different strategies. And finally, the player needs to defeat the boss. In addition, I set many hidden Health Pots and Mana Posts on the map to encourage the player to explore the map.</p>

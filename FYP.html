                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                   This project is my Capstone Project. This project aims to develop a dyslexia simulation VR game to let normal people experience the life of dyslexic children. By immersing players into the reality of dyslexic children, they will learn more about dyslexic people’s reading and writing difficulties. The player can also feel dyslexic children’s mental trauma which is caused by society’s ignorance and misunderstanding of this disease. The expected outcome of this project is raising people’s awareness of dyslexia and eliminating people’s misunderstanding of dyslexia.

                  <h3>Design of Each Scene</h3>
                   
                   <p> The game includes four different scenes to let the player experience a day for a primary school student with dyslexia. </p>
                   <p> 
                    Scene 1 is an English class. This scene focuses on English reading difficulty. In this scene, the player can experience how dyslexic people see English characters and feel the discrimination from teachers and classmates. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                    Scene 2 is a Chinese class. This scene focuses on Chinese reading and writing difficulties. In this scene, the player can experience how dyslexic people see and write Chinese characters. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                    Scene 3 is home. In this scene, the player can experience the pressure and the misunderstanding from the parents. Also, I want to use this scene to let the player know that children with dyslexia have a normal desire to learn. However, their enthusiasm for learning is often eroded by the incomprehension of their parents and teachers. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                    Scene 4 is a dream. In this scene, the player returns to Scene 1 with no symptoms of dyslexia. Everything seems so great. However, it is just a dream. I want to use this scene to let the player feel that dyslexic children are eager to be loved and accepted. But the reality is cruel.

                  <h3>Dyslexia Simulation</h3>
                   
                   <p> <b>English Reading Simulation</b> <br>
                    There are many different symptoms of dyslexia for English reading, such as confusing the order of letters in words, texts split apart, texts overlap, some characters are missing, some characters are repeated, the words are shaking, the lines become wavy. In this game, I successfully simulate these symptoms.As the figure shown below, the original texts on the blackboard are “English Class Dyslexia” and the original texts on the book are “Testing”. After processing, the order of letters in words changes. Some texts split apart, some words overlap, some letters in words are missing, and some letters in words are repeated. Also, all the words change randomly every few seconds, therefore, they look like shaking. 
                    <p><b>Chinese Reading Simulation</b> <br>
                     The main symptoms of dyslexia for Chinese reading is mistaking the structure of a character such as left and right reversed, upside down and mirror flip. Therefore, I simulate these symptoms in the game. The following figure shows a comparison between the correct characters and the processed characters. </p>
                     <p><b>Chinese Writing Simulation</b> <br>
                     One gameplay in this game is writing the revered Chinese character on the blackboard. There will be some samples of mirror characters or reversed characters on the blackboard and the player needs to write the mirror characters as the samples show. I want to use this gameplay to let the player experience the writing difficulty of dyslexic people.</p>
